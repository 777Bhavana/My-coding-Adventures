                Science is one of the Universe's most intriguing topic, actually THE most intriguing topic not only in genius scientist's views but 
                also in adults as well as kids . Children first learn about Science in primary school,and this is the time when some kids vow to hate 
                it for the rest of their lives while other( NERDS LIKE ME!!) pleadge love it for the rest of our lives .
                 but Science enthusiasts like us have very few notable scientists who we can look up to and that number reduces further down
